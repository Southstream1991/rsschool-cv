        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          As an amateur, I was studying HTML and CSS some time ago. For the lack
          of time, this was mostly about the basics but I really enjoyed the
          process. What I liked most was the opportunity to not only deal with
          Abstract (i.e. writing code) but also with Visual - to adjust fonts,
          colors, animations etc. – i.e. get the Visible Result of your work and
          admire it. Significant for me as a person of creative mindset. Based
          on that, I find Web Development a promising area to start a new
          career. My goal for now is to turn a hobby to a profession, to obtain
          skills and abilities to make my living in any place of today’s rapidly
          changing world.
