## Experience

As an amateur, I was studying HTML and CSS some time ago. For the lack of time, this was mostly about the basics but I really enjoyed the process. What I liked most was the opportunity to not only deal with Abstract (i.e. writing code) but also with Visual - to adjust fonts, colors, animations etc. â€“ i.e. get the Visible Result of your work and admire it. Significant for me as a person of creative mindset. Based on that, I find Web Development a promising area to start a new career. My goal for now is to turn a hobby to a profession, to obtain skills and abilities to make my living in any place of today's *rapidly changing world*.
